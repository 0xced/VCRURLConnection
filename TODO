* DRY up swizzle list (dupes in initialize and start)
* ensure correct behavior for initWithRequest:delegate:startImmediately:
* test handling of multiple connection:didReceiveResponse: calls (i.e. multipart responses with different types of data)
* test with a mock http server
* test loading of cassettes from files
* ensure request matching considers request body
